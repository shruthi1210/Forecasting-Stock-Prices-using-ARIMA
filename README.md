# Forecasting-Stock-Prices-using-ARIMA

To predict the prices of HCL, I used the ARIMA model. Using a Python tool, we will perform the forecast.The dataset is broken into two i.e. training and testing dataset. Model is trained using the training dataset and will finally predict the future of the stock for the testing period.

ARIMA models is one of statistical technique could be used to forecast time series data.

Time series data have trend, seasonality/cyclicality and noise components.

In ARIMA models, one has to decide on the order in such a way that error is reduced.

Model selection could be done using packages like pmdarima using tools like Python and R.


The packages that we are using are:

seaborn - Used for improved data visualization and better graphics

pmdarima – Used for model selection in time series forecasting

pandas – This package helps us data handling and data manipulations easy

datetime – Used to handle date and time objects

matplotlib - Used for data visualization and plotting 2D graphics
